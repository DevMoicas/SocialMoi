1. This is a small project started by Moises Grimaldo on March 19, 2025.

2.This project contains different links to my social media profiles, such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.

3. For this project, I used JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap. You can check index.html to see the code structure, 
and if you want to review the styles, take a look at style.css.

4. I created this project as a way to practice and improve my skills. However, there are other similar tools available, like Linktree.

5. For this app, i used the API from instagram in meta developers.
